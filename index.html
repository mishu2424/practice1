        <h2>Why Learn HTML?</h2>
        <p class="pr">
          HTML is the foundation of all web pages. Without HTML, you wouldn’t be
          able to organize text or add images or videos to your web pages. HTML
          is the beginning of everything you need to know to create engaging web
          pages!<a

          "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
          either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
          fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
          and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active
          participant in the World Wide Web.

        <h2>Why Learn CSS?</h2>
        <p class="pr">
          CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages,
          including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the
          presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens,
          small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used
          with any XML-based markup language.

                This command updates the index using the current content found
                in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next
                commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths
                as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add
                content with only part of the changes made to the working tree
                files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working
                tree anymore.

                Git commit creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your
                repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire
                repository at specific times. You should make new commits often,
                based around logical units of change. Over time, commits should
                tell a story of the history of your repository and how it came
                to be the way that it currently is. Commits include lots of
                metadata in addition to the contents and message, like the
                author, timestamp, and more.

              <td class="tab2">
                The git push command is used to upload local repository content
                to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from
                your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to

                  >git fetch</a
                >, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches,
                pushing exports commits to remote branches. Remote branches are
                configured using the
                <a
                  style="text-decoration: none"

                  >git remote</a
                >
                command. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution
                should be taken when pushing. These issues are discussed below.

            Linus-Torvalds-LinuxCon-Europe-2014Ten years ago this week, the
            Linux kernel community faced a daunting challenge: They could no
            longer use their revision control system BitKeeper and no other
            Source Control Management (SCMs) met their needs for a distributed
            system. Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, took the challenge
            into his own hands and disappeared over the weekend to emerge the
            following week with Git. Today Git is used for thousands of projects
            and has ushered in a new level of social coding among programmers.
            To celebrate this milestone, we asked Linus to share the
            behind-the-scenes story of Git and tell us what he thinks of the
            project and its impact on software development. You’ll find his
            comments in the story below. We’ll follow this Q&A with a week of
            Git in which we profile a different project each day that is using
            the revision control system. Look for the stories behind KVM, Qt,
            Drupal, Puppet and Wine, among others.

            The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.
            Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The
            most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which
            became an official standard in December 1999.

          <p>
            When it comes to web design, few people have been more important or
            influential than Håkon Wium Lie. Working at CERN alongside Tim
            Berners-Lee, the creator of the web itself, Lie is the man who gave
            it its familiar look by inventing CSS. Without that bold move, the
            whole business of web design could have been a totally different
            beast today. As Lie puts it: “This thing could have been owned by
            one company. It could have been France Telecom, it could have been
            Microsoft. It could have been one private owner. “Instead we have a
            web which is slightly disorganised, and there’s a lot of rubbish out
            there, but it’s also a wonderful place that reflects humanity as it
            should be. And it’s free for everyone to use.”
